# IphigenAI Desktop

Welcome to IphigenAI Desktop, the AI-powered application for systematic literature review and thesis writing.

## Main Features

IphigenAI Desktop helps you manage your research and write your thesis more efficiently:

- **Project Management**: Organize your research into separate projects.
- **Document Management**: Upload and manage your research papers and books (PDF).
- **AI Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extracts key information such as authors, year, and abstract from your papers.
- **AI Custom Analysis**: Ask specific questions about your documents and get answers based on their content. The AI can also suggest relevant questions.
- **Book Management**: Automatically splits long books into smaller sections for detailed analysis.
- **AI Thesis Outline Generation**: Get a draft of your thesis structure (chapters and sections) generated by the AI based on the documents in your project.
- **AI Thesis Content Generation**: Automatically generate content for your thesis sections, using the papers you selected as references.
- **Editing and Export**: Modify the generated structure and content, then export the bibliography and the complete thesis (e.g., in DOCX format).
- **Local Execution**: The application runs entirely on your computer.
- **Data Privacy**: Your documents and project data remain on your computer. Only the queries necessary for AI features are sent to cloud services (in compliance with the active license).
- **Automatic Updates**: Receive notifications and easily install new versions of the application.
- **Flexible Licensing**: Choose from different license options to unlock advanced features.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux (Electron-supported versions)
- **Disk Space**: At least 500MB of free space (more space required for your documents)
- **RAM**: At least 4GB of RAM (8GB or more recommended for large projects)
- **Google Gemini API Key**: Required for AI features. You can get one for free from Google AI Studio. For optimal performance (higher request limits), enabling billing on your Google Cloud account associated with the API key is recommended.
